# Linux Serial Ports
Welcome to the coding grounds for real and pseudo-terminal serial ports in linux!

In this folder, you'll find progressively evolving examples of serial port usage in C (mostly). 

Ideally, using heavy source code commenting and readme documentation, this directory should be of use to any of us in need of quick, informative and working examples of various aspects of serial port I/O in linux.
