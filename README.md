# CubeSat-Communication-Protocol
Repository for the LORIS Groundstation to CubeSat Communication Protocol (LCP)

## Linux Serial Ports
In this folder, you'll find C code that puts real and pseudo-terminal serial ports to work.

Using separate but progressively evolving examples, relevant code is written, heavily commented upon and uploaded to provide helpful stepping stones in uncovering useful features for the LORIS project.
