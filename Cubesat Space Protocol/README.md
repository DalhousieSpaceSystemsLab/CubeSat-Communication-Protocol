# Cubesat Space Protocol
This folder is dedicated to the exploration of the Cubesat Space Protocol (CSP).

## Motive
The main motive for the exploration of this protocol is to see how well it fits the LCP design objectives out of the box.

If the CSP successfully passes more stringent tests to ensure it fits the performance and technical requirements of our project, it shall be used as the backend for the LCP.
